 with a focus on access, encapsulation, and scope. Here are some of the main takeaways from this lesson:

The public and private keywords are used to define what parts of code have access to other classes,

Encapsulation is a technique used to keep implementation details hidden from other classes. Its aim is to create small bundles of logic.
The this keyword can be used to designate the difference between instance variables and local variables.
Local variables can only be used within the scope that they were defined in.
The this keyword can be used to call methods when writing classes.
Instructions
In the code editor, weâ€™ve provided the full code for Bank.java and CheckingAccount.java.

Run the code and try to experiment with the private and public keywords.

Here are some ideas that you can experiment with:

Create a method to close an account.
Method to apply fees or charges.
Introduce different currencies into the code.
